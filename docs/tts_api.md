# Text to speech
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech

Learn how to turn text into lifelike spoken audio.

## Overview

The Audio API provides a [`speech`](/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech) endpoint based on our [TTS (text-to-speech) model](/docs/models#tts). It comes with 6 built-in voices and can be used to:

*   Narrate a written blog post
*   Produce spoken audio in multiple languages
*   Give real time audio output using streaming

Here is an example of the `alloy` voice:

Please note that our [usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) require you to provide a clear disclosure to end users that the TTS voice they are hearing is AI-generated and not a human voice.

## Quickstart

The `speech` endpoint takes in three key inputs: the [model](/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech#audio-createspeech-model), the [text](/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech#audio-createspeech-input) that should be turned into audio, and the [voice](/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech#audio-createspeech-voice) to be used for the audio generation. A simple request would look like the following:

Generate spoken audio from input text

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();
const speechFile = path.resolve("./speech.mp3");

const mp3 = await openai.audio.speech.create({
  model: "tts-1",
  voice: "alloy",
  input: "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
});

const buffer = Buffer.from(await mp3.arrayBuffer());
await fs.promises.writeFile(speechFile, buffer);
```

```python
from pathlib import Path
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
speech_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "speech.mp3"
response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",
    input="Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
)
response.stream_to_file(speech_file_path)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "Today is a wonderful day to build something people love!",
    "voice": "alloy"
  }' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

By default, the endpoint will output a MP3 file of the spoken audio but it can also be configured to output any of our [supported formats](#supported-output-formats).

### Audio quality

For real-time applications, the standard `tts-1` model provides the lowest latency but at a lower quality than the `tts-1-hd` model. Due to the way the audio is generated, `tts-1` is likely to generate content that has more static in certain situations than `tts-1-hd`. In some cases, the audio may not have noticeable differences depending on your listening device and the individual person.

### Voice options

Experiment with different voices (`alloy`, `ash`, `coral`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `sage` and `shimmer`) to find one that matches your desired tone and audience. The current voices are optimized for English.

### Streaming real time audio

The Speech API provides support for real time audio streaming using [chunk transfer encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding). This means that the audio is able to be played before the full file has been generated and made accessible.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",
    input="Hello world! This is a streaming test.",
)

response.stream_to_file("output.mp3")
```

## Supported output formats

The default response format is "mp3", but other formats like "opus", "aac", "flac", and "pcm" are available.

*   **Opus**: For internet streaming and communication, low latency.
*   **AAC**: For digital audio compression, preferred by YouTube, Android, iOS.
*   **FLAC**: For lossless audio compression, favored by audio enthusiasts for archiving.
*   **WAV**: Uncompressed WAV audio, suitable for low-latency applications to avoid decoding overhead.
*   **PCM**: Similar to WAV but containing the raw samples in 24kHz (16-bit signed, low-endian), without the header.

## Supported languages

The TTS model generally follows the Whisper model in terms of language support. Whisper [supports the following languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) and performs well despite the current voices being optimized for English:

Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

You can generate spoken audio in these languages by providing the input text in the language of your choice.

## FAQ

### How can I control the emotional range of the generated audio?

There is no direct mechanism to control the emotional output of the audio generated. Certain factors may influence the output audio like capitalization or grammar but our internal tests with these have yielded mixed results.

### Can I create a custom copy of my own voice?

No, this is not something we support.

### Do I own the outputted audio files?

Yes, like with all outputs from our API, the person who created them owns the output. You are still required to inform end users that they are hearing audio generated by AI and not a real person talking to them.

# Speech to text
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text

Learn how to turn audio into text.

## Overview

The Audio API provides two speech to text endpoints, `transcriptions` and `translations`, based on our state-of-the-art open source large-v2 [Whisper model](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/). They can be used to:

*   Transcribe audio into whatever language the audio is in.
*   Translate and transcribe the audio into english.

File uploads are currently limited to 25 MB and the following input file types are supported: `mp3`, `mp4`, `mpeg`, `mpga`, `m4a`, `wav`, and `webm`.

## Quickstart

### Transcriptions

The transcriptions API takes as input the audio file you want to transcribe and the desired output file format for the transcription of the audio. We currently support multiple input and output file formats.

Transcribe audio

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file/audio.mp3"),
  model: "whisper-1",
});

console.log(transcription.text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file= open("/path/to/file/audio.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="whisper-1", 
    file=audio_file
)

print(transcription.text)
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form file=@/path/to/file/audio.mp3 \
  --form model=whisper-1
```

By default, the response type will be json with the raw text included.

{ "text": "Imagine the wildest idea that you've ever had, and you're curious about how it might scale to something that's a 100, a 1,000 times bigger. .... }

The Audio API also allows you to set additional parameters in a request. For example, if you want to set the `response_format` as `text`, your request would look like the following:

Additional options

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file/speech.mp3"),
  model: "whisper-1",
  response_format: "text",
});

console.log(transcription.text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/speech.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="whisper-1", 
    file=audio_file, 
    response_format="text"
)

print(transcription.text)
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form file=@/path/to/file/speech.mp3 \
  --form model=whisper-1 \
  --form response_format=text
```

The [API Reference](/docs/api-reference/audio) includes the full list of available parameters.

### Translations

The translations API takes as input the audio file in any of the supported languages and transcribes, if necessary, the audio into English. This differs from our /Transcriptions endpoint since the output is not in the original input language and is instead translated to English text.

Translate audio

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const transcription = await openai.audio.translations.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file/german.mp3"),
  model: "whisper-1",
});

console.log(transcription.text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/german.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.translations.create(
    model="whisper-1", 
    file=audio_file,
)

print(transcription.text)
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/translations \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form file=@/path/to/file/german.mp3 \
  --form model=whisper-1 \
```

In this case, the inputted audio was german and the outputted text looks like:

Hello, my name is Wolfgang and I come from Germany. Where are you heading today?

We only support translation into English at this time.

## Supported languages

We currently [support the following languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) through both the `transcriptions` and `translations` endpoint:

Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

While the underlying model was trained on 98 languages, we only list the languages that exceeded <50% [word error rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_error_rate) (WER) which is an industry standard benchmark for speech to text model accuracy. The model will return results for languages not listed above but the quality will be low.

## Timestamps

By default, the Whisper API will output a transcript of the provided audio in text. The [`timestamp_granularities[]` parameter](/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription#audio-createtranscription-timestamp_granularities) enables a more structured and timestamped json output format, with timestamps at the segment, word level, or both. This enables word-level precision for transcripts and video edits, which allows for the removal of specific frames tied to individual words.

Timestamp options

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("audio.mp3"),
  model: "whisper-1",
  response_format: "verbose_json",
  timestamp_granularities: ["word"]
});

console.log(transcription.words);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/speech.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    file=audio_file,
    model="whisper-1",
    response_format="verbose_json",
    timestamp_granularities=["word"]
)

print(transcription.words)
```

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F file="@/path/to/file/audio.mp3" \
  -F "timestamp_granularities[]=word" \
  -F model="whisper-1" \
  -F response_format="verbose_json"
```

## Longer inputs

By default, the Whisper API only supports files that are less than 25 MB. If you have an audio file that is longer than that, you will need to break it up into chunks of 25 MB's or less or used a compressed audio format. To get the best performance, we suggest that you avoid breaking the audio up mid-sentence as this may cause some context to be lost.

One way to handle this is to use the [PyDub open source Python package](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) to split the audio:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

song = AudioSegment.from_mp3("good_morning.mp3")

# PyDub handles time in milliseconds
ten_minutes = 10 * 60 * 1000

first_10_minutes = song[:ten_minutes]

first_10_minutes.export("good_morning_10.mp3", format="mp3")
```

_OpenAI makes no guarantees about the usability or security of 3rd party software like PyDub._

## Prompting

You can use a [prompt](/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription#audio/createTranscription-prompt) to improve the quality of the transcripts generated by the Whisper API. The model tries to match the style of the prompt, so it's more likely to use capitalization and punctuation if the prompt does too. However, the current prompting system is more limited than our other language models and provides limited control over the generated audio.

Here are some examples of how prompting can help in different scenarios:

1.  Prompts can help correct specific words or acronyms that the model misrecognizes in the audio. For example, the following prompt improves the transcription of the words DALL·E and GPT-3, which were previously written as "GDP 3" and "DALI": "The transcript is about OpenAI which makes technology like DALL·E, GPT-3, and ChatGPT with the hope of one day building an AGI system that benefits all of humanity."
2.  To preserve the context of a file that was split into segments, prompt the model with the transcript of the preceding segment. The model uses relevant information from the previous audio, improving transcription accuracy. The model only considers the final 224 tokens of the prompt and ignores anything earlier. For multilingual inputs, Whisper uses a custom tokenizer. For English-only inputs, it uses the standard GPT-2 tokenizer. Find both tokenizers in the open source [Whisper Python package](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py#L361).
3.  Sometimes the model skips punctuation in the transcript. To prevent this, use a simple prompt that includes punctuation: "Hello, welcome to my lecture."
4.  The model may also leave out common filler words in the audio. If you want to keep the filler words in your transcript, use a prompt that contains them: "Umm, let me think like, hmm... Okay, here's what I'm, like, thinking."
5.  Some languages can be written in different ways, such as simplified or traditional Chinese. The model might not always use the writing style that you want for your transcript by default. You can improve this by using a prompt in your preferred writing style.

## Improving reliability

One of the most common challenges faced when using Whisper is the model often does not recognize uncommon words or acronyms. Here are some different techniques to improve the reliability of Whisper in these cases:

### Using the prompt parameter

The first method involves using the optional prompt parameter to pass a dictionary of the correct spellings.

Because it wasn't trained with instruction-following techniques, Whisper operates more like a base GPT model. Keep in mind that Whisper only considers the first 224 tokens of the prompt.

Prompt parameter

```javascript
import fs from "fs";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: fs.createReadStream("/path/to/file/speech.mp3"),
  model: "whisper-1",
  response_format: "text",
  prompt:"ZyntriQix, Digique Plus, CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, OrbitalLink Seven, DigiFractal Matrix, PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., Q.U.A.R.T.Z., F.L.I.N.T.",
});

console.log(transcription.text);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

audio_file = open("/path/to/file/speech.mp3", "rb")
transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="whisper-1", 
    file=audio_file, 
    response_format="text",
    prompt="ZyntriQix, Digique Plus, CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, OrbitalLink Seven, DigiFractal Matrix, PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., Q.U.A.R.T.Z., F.L.I.N.T."
)

print(transcription.text)
```

While it increases reliability, this technique is limited to 224 tokens, so your list of SKUs needs to be relatively small for this to be a scalable solution.

### Post-processing with GPT-4

The second method involves a post-processing step using GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo.

We start by providing instructions for GPT-4 through the `system_prompt` variable. Similar to what we did with the prompt parameter earlier, we can define our company and product names.

Post-processing

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `
You are a helpful assistant for the company ZyntriQix. Your task is 
to correct any spelling discrepancies in the transcribed text. Make 
sure that the names of the following products are spelled correctly: 
ZyntriQix, Digique Plus, CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, 
OrbitalLink Seven, DigiFractal Matrix, PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., 
Q.U.A.R.T.Z., F.L.I.N.T. Only add necessary punctuation such as 
periods, commas, and capitalization, and use only the context provided.
`;

const transcript = await transcribe(audioFile);
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  temperature: temperature,
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: systemPrompt
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: transcript
    }
  ],
  store: true,
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python
system_prompt = """
You are a helpful assistant for the company ZyntriQix. Your task is to correct 
any spelling discrepancies in the transcribed text. Make sure that the names of 
the following products are spelled correctly: ZyntriQix, Digique Plus, 
CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, OrbitalLink Seven, DigiFractal 
Matrix, PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., Q.U.A.R.T.Z., F.L.I.N.T. Only add necessary 
punctuation such as periods, commas, and capitalization, and use only the 
context provided.
"""

def generate_corrected_transcript(temperature, system_prompt, audio_file):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        temperature=temperature,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": system_prompt
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcribe(audio_file, "")
            }
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
corrected_text = generate_corrected_transcript(
    0, system_prompt, fake_company_filepath
)
```

If you try this on your own audio file, you'll see that GPT-4 corrects many misspellings in the transcript. Due to its larger context window, this method might be more scalable than using Whisper's prompt parameter. It's also more reliable, as GPT-4 can be instructed and guided in ways that aren't possible with Whisper due to its lack of instruction following.
